## Koch Method, LCWO

I’m learning Morse code using the Koch method <strike>15</strike> 20 wpm I’ll keep this chart updated with my progress.

_Update:_ I've switched to mostly using [Learn CW Online](http://lcwo.net) and I've upped my character speed to 20 wpm.

_Update:_ (2019-11-15) Added another blog post about how I'm [back at it]({% post_url 2019-10-28-back-on-the-wagon %}) after taking most of the summer off.

# CWOps Academy

As a more recent addition, I've enrolled in [CW Academy](https://cwops.org/cw-academy-2/cw-academy/) at Level 1 (total n00b).
The class starts April 1, 2019.
I will also post updates about that as it goes.
Hopefully my slight efforts here will at least give me a _tiny_ boost ;)
Yeah, right.

I finished the level 1 class in May 2019.
Yay!
