I joined the [Long Island CW Club](https://longislandcwclub.org).
This is a practice-focused club that runs various get-on-the-air classes every week.
I've been trying to attend the _B1/B2 Review_ and the _Intermediate_ class.
Both of those focus on learners who've mastered all the characters and are working on upping their speed and instant character recognition.

## Morse Code Ninja (Spring 2020)

After CWOps and LCWO, my next course will be Morse Code Ninja.
[Morse Code Ninja](https://morsecode.ninja) is a series of YouTube videos by [AD0WE](https://www.qrz.com/db/AD0WE) that teaches Morse Code with a focus on head copy.
There's lots of good information on his site, both about learning Morse code and about learning in general.

## Koch Method, LCWO (Fall 2019)

I’m learning Morse code using the Koch method <strike>15</strike> 20 wpm I’ll keep this chart updated with my progress.

_Update:_ (2019-10-28) Added another blog post about how I'm [back at it]({% post_url 2019-10-28-back-on-the-wagon %}) after taking most of the summer off.

_Update:_ I've switched to mostly using [Learn CW Online](http://lcwo.net) and I've upped my character speed to 20 wpm.

_Update:_ (2020-04-29) I finished off the 40-lesson LCWO course!
I blogged about it here: [Finished Morse!]({% post_url 2020-04-29-finished-morse %})

## CWOps Academy (Spring 2019)

As a more recent addition, I've enrolled in [CW Academy](https://cwops.org/cw-academy-2/cw-academy/) at Level 1 (total n00b).
The class starts April 1, 2019.
I will also post updates about that as it goes.
Hopefully my slight efforts here will at least give me a _tiny_ boost ;)
Yeah, right.

I finished the level 1 class in May 2019.
Yay!
