I picked up a 3d printed morse key online.
It’s pretty cheap yet it feels solid.
On the radio side, there’s a built-in keyer circuit.
This circuit is set up so that pressing one paddle produces a stream of either dots or dashes as long as an electrical connection is made.
That's old news to any ham, but I thought it was kind of cool.
