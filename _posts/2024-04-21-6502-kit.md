![Ben Eater 6502 Kit]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/6502_kit.jpg)

I picked up [Ben Eater's 6502 kit](https://eater.net/6502) so that I could follow along with [his videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU).
I'm posting this just to have a place to put any progress that I make on the kit.
So far, I've started working on the [clock module](https://eater.net/8bit/clock), which is a separate kit.

Enjoy following along.
