I had recently asked on Twitter if QSL cards were still a thing.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So do people send QSL cards anymore or is it all just LotW now? It seems like itâ€™d be fun to collect at least some.</p>&mdash; Chris KD9KJV (@Kd9Kjv) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kd9Kjv/status/1218648588823269376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And wouldn't you know it, within a day or two I got one in the mail! Nice. This
was from a contact on a local repeater, but we had a nice chat and so it was
cool to get the card in the mail. Next step, send one back. As usual, I jumped
the gun way early and had 25 QSL created even before I had an HF radio. But at
least that means that I have something that I can send right away.

On the morse front, I've been keeping up with it pretty well. I'm up to lesson
29 of 40. I know most of the letters, numbers, and common punctuation. Some days
the code feels like an undifferentiated mush of beeps and boops. Other days it
is as clear as the top line on an eye chart.

Lastly, I presented a talk at work encouraging my colleagues to get licensed. It
seems like it was well-received. I've submitted it as a talk at
[THAT Conference](http://thatconference.com) as well. We'll see if it gets
picked up.
