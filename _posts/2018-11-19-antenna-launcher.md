I picked up a kit for building an antenna launcher something like this: http://www.antennalaunchers.com/antlaunching.html
I’m hoping that I’ll be able to shoot over the tree in my front yard, my house, and the even more gigantic tree in my back yard.
I’ll post pictures when I put the plan into action.

I also started to pick up some Powerpole connectors.
I’m going to try and standardize on 12V with a common connector for all gear.
I can wire up some cables to the solar panel with the same connectors.
