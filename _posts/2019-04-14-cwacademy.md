"CW" is amateur radio lingo for "morse," roughly.
It's an antiquated reference to "continuous wave" which in turn is meant to distinguish from the _very_ ancient times when morse transmissions (the only kind) were just [spark gaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark-gap_transmitter).

CW Academy is an online 8-week course meant to bring someone who's never done morse code (me) up to a reasonable standard.
I'm in week 3 of meeting twice per week and it's been going pretty well.
Now I'm up to doing several letters and numbers, both being able to understand them, _copy_, and to send.

And because this is ham radio, it also involves some gear:

This is (as I understand it) sort of the standard _iambic key_, having two paddles.

One thing that I want to dig into more is the intersection between morse and really early computer hardware.
I haven't seen anything explicitly, but I'm assuming that there's a crossover between morse [prosigns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosigns_for_Morse_code) and teletype control codes.
And then in turn, there's definitely a straight line from teletype control characters and modern terminal emulators.
This strikes me as pretty cool that there could be a direct lineage from what we put in text files today with, 150+ year old communication modes.
